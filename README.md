# Helping-Hand-Android

Simple Android application consisting of a web view linking to the Heroku deployment of my Rails FYP.

Please Note: Due to some bootstrap bug the collapsed navbar does not seem to work on mobile devices. This issue is being looked into as it works on resized desktop browsers and Chrome when set to be a mobile browser. This appears to be a known Bootstrap issue but the presented solutions have not remedied it so far.
